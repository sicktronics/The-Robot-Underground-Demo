# The Robot Underground
Jump into a world of wiring, coding, and testing robots as you unravel the disappearance of your coworker and friend Jefe. While it's too risky for you to waltz into a government research facility yourself, you and your partner Temp devise a plan to send a robot in to infiltrate instead. Gather information and find out what other secrets they've been hiding!
